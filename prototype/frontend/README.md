VRF Subscription ID: `20136374336138753384898843390506225296052091906296406953567310616148092014984`

## Game Flow

1. **New Game** — calls `createGame()`, requests Chainlink VRF seed
2. **Pick Your Case** — choose 1 of 5 briefcases (value unknown — quantum superposition)
3. **Rounds 1-3** — CRE confidential case opening:
   - Select a case -> **Open Case** (1 TX — no commit-reveal needed)
   - CRE enclave computes the collapsed value using VRF seed + game secret
   - **Ring the Banker** -> on-chain offer calculated with EV + variance + psychology
   - **DEAL** (accept offer, game over) or **NO DEAL** (next round)
4. **Final Decision** — 2 cases remain: **KEEP** your case or **SWAP**
5. **Game Over** — all cases revealed, final payout shown + jackpot if sponsored

## Sponsor Jackpot (CRE Log Trigger)

A CRE log-trigger workflow adds to the jackpot on each case opening. The amount is drawn from the range between the 2nd-highest and highest remaining case values. If the player goes "no deal" all the way, they can claim the jackpot. Games have a 10-minute timer — if the game expires, the jackpot is returned to the sponsor.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript
- wagmi v2 + viem v2 + TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Chainlink VRF v2.5 + Price Feeds (ETH/USD)
- Chainlink CRE (Confidential Compute + Cron Workflows)

## Case Values

$0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.50, $1.00

## Watch Mode (Spectator UX)

No wallet needed. Spectate any game in real time.

- `/watch` — lobby with game ID input + "jump to latest" shortcut
- `/watch/[id]` — full spectator view with sidebar, rotating sponsor ads, event log
- Channel controls: ◀ Choose Game ▶ to navigate between games
- Ads are seeded by gameId for deterministic per-game shuffle order

## Sponsor Ads

Typed ad system in `lib/ads.ts` with `SponsorAd` interface. Unified `RotatingAd` component supports `sidebar` and `break` variants. Sponsor logos in `public/sponsors/`.

Current sponsors: Ceptor Club, Chainlink, letswritean.email, Wingbird Enterprises, CyberJam, ENS, Deal or NOT, Rick Roll University, The Banker's Therapy Fund.

**Future**: Refactor `SponsorJackpot` into separate `Sponsor` and `Jackpot` contracts. Sponsors write ads on-chain by sending funds — the Sponsor contract stores ad text/logo and forwards funds to the Jackpot. The frontend reads ads from the Sponsor contract instead of the static `lib/ads.ts` array.

### Running Tests

```bash
npx tsx --test lib/ads.test.ts
```

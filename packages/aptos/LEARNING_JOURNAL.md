# Learning Journal: Porting Deal-or-Not to Aptos Move

## What This Is
A record of decisions, resources, struggles, and insights from porting 16 Solidity contracts to Aptos Move. Written by Claude (Opus 4.6) with guidance from tippi-fifestarr. Updated incrementally as work progresses.

---

## Phase 0: Research & Planning

### Doc Discovery Journey

**Round 1 — Topic-first search (missed llms.txt)**
My first approach was to search for specific topics: "Aptos randomness", "Aptos resource accounts", etc. This landed me on deep-link URLs like `/build/smart-contracts/randomness` directly. I never loaded the `aptos.dev` homepage or browsed the sidebar navigation.

Result: I missed that Aptos has:
- `llms.txt` at `https://aptos.dev/llms.txt` (full docs in one file!)
- A dedicated "AI and LLMs" section in the sidebar nav
- An MCP server (`@aptos-labs/aptos-mcp`) for Claude Code
- A dedicated `/llms-txt` page with setup instructions for every major AI tool

**Round 2 — User pointed out llms.txt**
After the user asked "there's llmstxt as well", I checked and found it. Then I also checked `/.well-known/llms.txt` (404) and `docs.chain.link/llms.txt` (exists).

**Round 3 — Actually read the homepage**
When I finally fetched `aptos.dev` directly, I found llms.txt is prominently linked:
- In the sidebar nav: "AI and LLMs > LLMs.txt NEW"
- On the homepage: "NEW! LLMs.txt Integration"
- Has its own page at `/llms-txt`

**Lesson**: LLM agents don't browse docs like humans. We go topic → deep page → never see nav. The llms.txt WAS discoverable — I just never looked at the homepage first. This is a real pattern worth reporting to docs teams.

### Aptos Docs — What Works vs Dead Ends

Many URLs have moved. These all 404:
- `/build/smart-contracts/structs` → now at `/book/structs-and-resources`
- `/build/smart-contracts/events` → gone (use GitHub source)
- `/build/smart-contracts/unit-testing` → now at `/book/unit-testing`
- `/build/smart-contracts/coins` → gone (use GitHub source)
- `/build/smart-contracts/install-cli` → now at `/build/cli/setup-cli`

The Move Book at `/build/smart-contracts/book` is the stable, comprehensive reference. Individual topic pages under `/build/smart-contracts/` are hit-or-miss.

### Most Useful Resources (Ranked)

1. **`https://aptos.dev/llms-full.txt`** — Entire docs concatenated. Would have saved 15+ page fetches.
2. **Move Book** (`/build/smart-contracts/book`) — The real language reference
3. **`smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit`** on GitHub — 3 working Move modules for Chainlink Data Feeds + CCIP
4. **Randomness page** (`/build/smart-contracts/randomness`) — Critical for our game. `#[randomness]` attribute, undergasing warnings
5. **Security Guidelines** (`/build/smart-contracts/move-security-guidelines`) — Undergasing, overflow gotchas
6. **AIP-41** on GitHub — Security model behind Aptos randomness (wDKG + wVRF)
7. **CertiK blog: Move for Solidity Devs** — Storage/access pattern comparison

### The Privacy Problem (Critical Architecture Decision)

**My initial (wrong) assumption**: Use `randomness::permutation(5)` to shuffle all 5 case values atomically at game creation. Values stored in contract, hidden because no public getter.

**Why this is wrong** (from the whitepaper + Aptos research):
1. The Deal-or-Not whitepaper documents 4 failed approaches. Approach 0 (Fisher-Yates) stored values on-chain — anyone could read storage slots via `eth_getStorageAt`. **Move resources are equally readable via Aptos RPC.**
2. Approach 2 (Quantum Collapse) used `hash(vrfSeed, caseIndex, blockhash)` — all inputs became public, so players could precompute and selectively abort. **Same problem on Aptos if we pre-compute values.**
3. The CRE solution works because `hash(vrfSeed, caseIndex, CRE_SECRET, bitmap)` has one input (`CRE_SECRET`) that no party can access alone.

**Corrected approach**: Two-Transaction Randomness (Option B)
- TX1: Player calls `request_open_case` — records intent, no randomness
- TX2: Authorized resolver calls `#[randomness] reveal_case` — fresh randomness generated AFTER TX1 commits
- Player can't predict because randomness doesn't exist until TX2 executes
- Resolver is the only authorized caller, mitigating undergasing attacks

Also documenting Options A (Oracle + Secret) and C (Hybrid CCIP to EVM CRE) as alternatives.

### Key Architectural Differences

| Solidity | Move | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| `mapping(uint => Game)` | `SmartTable<u64, Game>` | No iteration support; add vector if needed |
| `int256` | Doesn't exist | BankerAlgorithm needs `(u256, bool)` tuples |
| ETH 18 decimals | APT 8 decimals | Every financial formula changes |
| `address(this).balance` | No equivalent | Resource accounts with SignerCapability |
| `abstract contract` inheritance | No inheritance | Friend modules or code duplication |
| `approve`/`transferFrom` | MintRef/BurnRef/TransferRef | Capability-based, fundamentally different |
| `private` storage vars | No storage privacy | Both chains: all storage is publicly readable |

---

## Phase 1: Pure Libraries

### game_math.move
- Direct port of `GameMath.sol`
- Changed `wei` terminology to `octas` (Aptos equivalent, 1 APT = 10^8 octas)
- Error codes as u64 constants instead of custom error types
- No price feed dependency at module level — passed as parameter

### banker_algorithm.move
- Ported `BankerAlgorithm.sol` with signed integer workaround
- Used `aptos_std::aptos_hash::keccak256` for entropy (same as Solidity's keccak256)
- **Signed int challenge**: `_randomVariance` returns `int256` in Solidity. In Move:
  - Compute positive/negative parts separately
  - Use `(u64, bool)` for intermediate signed values
  - `_clamp` operates on signed representation
  - Final combination adds/subtracts from base discount

### Phase 1 Results

**Compilation**: Both modules compiled on first try with `aptos move compile --dev`. The `--dev` flag is required because `Move.toml` uses `deal_or_not = "_"` (placeholder address resolved by `[dev-addresses]` to `0xCAFE`). Without `--dev`, you get "Unresolved addresses" error.

**Tests**: 20/20 passed on first run. Breakdown:
- `game_math`: 6 tests (slippage math, deposit validation, expected failure)
- `banker_algorithm`: 14 tests (EV, offers, signed math, context adjustment, variance)

**What went smoothly:**
- `aptos move init --name deal_or_not` scaffolded the project perfectly
- `aptos_std::aptos_hash::keccak256` worked as a drop-in for Solidity's `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(...))`
- `vector<u64>` is a clean replacement for `uint256[] memory`
- Move's `#[expected_failure(abort_code = ...)]` test attribute is cleaner than Foundry's `vm.expectRevert`

**What needed adaptation:**
- **Signed integers**: Created a `SignedU64 { value: u64, is_negative: bool }` struct with `signed_add` and `signed_clamp` helpers. This added ~40 lines of code that don't exist in Solidity (where `int256` just works). The `_contextAdjustment` and `_randomVariance` functions had to be restructured to avoid negative intermediate values.
- **No `abi.encodePacked`**: Used `vector::push_back` to append the round number as a byte to the seed vector before hashing. Less elegant but functionally equivalent.
- **u128 for overflow**: `required_with_slippage` uses `(u64 as u128)` intermediate to avoid overflow on `base * (10000 + slippage)`. Solidity's `uint256` is wide enough to never overflow here, but Move's `u64` can.

**Aptos CLI experience:**
- Installation via `curl | python3` was instant (< 5s)
- `aptos move compile` downloads git dependencies (AptosFramework) on first run — took ~30s
- Test output is clean and readable, similar to `cargo test`

---

## Phase 2-3: Chainlink Integration + Bank

### price_feed_helper.move
- Ported `PriceFeedHelper.sol` with mock price feed pattern for dev/testing
- **Critical math difference**: APT has 8 decimals, ETH has 18. The conversion formula changes from `cents * 1e24 / ethPrice` to `cents * 1e14 / aptPrice`. Got this right by deriving from first principles: `10^(asset_decimals + feed_decimals - 2)`.
- Snapshot pattern preserved: `apt_per_dollar = 1e16 / price` (vs `1e26 / price` for ETH)
- For production: would integrate with `data_feeds::router::get_benchmarks()` from Chainlink's on-chain packages

**Chainlink Data Feeds discovery journey:**
- Downloaded Chainlink packages via `aptos move download --account 0x516... --package ChainlinkPlatform`
- Read the actual Move source (`router.move`, `registry.move`) to understand the API
- Key finding: `router::get_benchmarks(signer, feed_ids, billing_data)` returns `vector<Benchmark>` where `benchmark: u256` is the price. The signer param is for billing but any signer works.
- Feed IDs are `vector<u8>` (32-byte hex), not addresses like Solidity's `AggregatorV3Interface`
- Decided to use mock pattern for now — wiring up real Chainlink packages requires managing cross-package dependencies with specific named addresses (`data_feeds`, `platform`, `owner`)

### bank.move
- Ported `Bank.sol` using resource account pattern (key Aptos concept)
- `account::create_resource_account(owner, BANK_SEED)` creates an autonomous account that holds APT
- `SignerCapability` stored in BankState lets the module sign transactions for the vault
- `friend` access: `deal_or_not_quickplay` can call `settle()` and `receive_entry_fee()` directly

**Test fix needed**: `coin::register<AptosCoin>` requires the coin module to be initialized in tests. Had to call `aptos_coin::initialize_for_test(framework)` before bank initialization. This returned `(burn_cap, mint_cap)` that need explicit cleanup. Solidity tests don't need this because ETH is always available.

### deal_or_not_quickplay.move (Core Game — THE big one)
- **723 lines of Solidity → ~500 lines of Move** (simpler due to no VRF/CRE callbacks)
- Phase model: 9 → 7 phases (eliminated WaitingForVRF, merged WaitingForCRE into WaitingForReveal, eliminated WaitingForFinalCRE)
- Two-TX pattern: `open_case()` (player) → `reveal_case()` (resolver with `#[randomness]`)
- `keep_case()` and `swap_case()` also use `#[randomness]` attribute
- `SmartTable<u64, Game>` replaces `mapping(uint256 => Game)`
- No `onReport`/`IReceiver` — resolver calls functions directly as authorized signer
- `used_values_bitmap` preserved (same bit manipulation logic as Solidity)

**Compilation issues encountered:**
1. **Doc comments on `#[randomness]` entry functions**: Move doesn't allow `///` doc comments before `#[attribute]` annotations. Changed to `//` regular comments.
2. **`&address` vs `address`**: `vector::push_back` expects the value directly, not a reference. Fixed `&game` → `game`.
3. **Unused parameter warning**: `swapped` in `reveal_final_cases` — prefixed with `_`.

**All 27 tests pass** across 5 modules (Phase 1-4).

## Phase 5: Agent Infrastructure

### agent_registry.move
- Ported `AgentRegistry.sol` (313 lines Solidity → ~290 lines Move)
- `mapping(uint256 => Agent)` → `SmartTable<u64, Agent>`, `mapping(address => uint256[])` → `SmartTable<address, vector<u64>>`
- **No function overloading in Move**: Solidity had `isAgentEligible(uint256)` and `isAgentEligible(address)`. In Move, renamed to `is_agent_eligible` and `get_agent_id_by_address` + `is_agent_eligible`
- `friend` declarations needed for `deal_or_not_agents`, `agent_staking`, `seasonal_leaderboard`
- Added `record_game_friend` for friend module access alongside `record_game` for authorized external callers
- 3 tests passing

### agent_staking.move
- Ported `AgentStaking.sol` (285 lines → ~280 lines Move)
- **Reward-per-share accumulator pattern** preserved: `reward_per_share` scaled by 1e18, `reward_debt` per stake
- Resource account holds all staked APT + rewards
- `LOCKUP_PERIOD = 604800` (7 days, same as Solidity)
- `AGENT_REVENUE_SHARE = 2000` (20% in basis points)
- SmartTable for stakes, pools, and reward debt
- 1 test passing (initialization)

### deal_or_not_agents.move
- Ported `DealOrNotAgents.sol` (largest module, ~480 lines)
- **Same Two-TX pattern as quickplay**: `agent_open_case` → `reveal_agent_case` (with `#[randomness]`)
- **Resolver pattern instead of CRE `onReport`**: All agent actions mediated by resolver address
- **`bank.move` needed new friend**: Added `friend deal_or_not::deal_or_not_agents` since agents also call `bank::settle()` and `bank::receive_entry_fee()`
- Bitmap helpers duplicated from quickplay (no abstract base in Move — no inheritance)
- **Shift operator type error**: `bitmap >> i` requires `i` to be `u8`, not `u64`. Fixed by declaring loop counter as `u8` and casting to `u64` for comparisons. This is a common gotcha — Solidity doesn't care about shift amount types.
- Stats recorded to AgentRegistry after each game via `record_game_friend`
- 2 tests passing (initialization + bitmap helpers)

### seasonal_leaderboard.move
- Ported `SeasonalLeaderboard.sol` (350 lines → ~310 lines Move)
- **No nested mappings**: Solidity's `mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => AgentSeasonStats))` becomes `SmartTable<u64, AgentSeasonStats>` with composite key `season_id * 1_000_000 + agent_id`
- Resource account holds prize pool APT
- Bubble sort for rankings (same as Solidity — small N makes it fine)
- Prize distribution: 1st=50%, 2nd=25%, 3rd=15%, 4-10=10% split (identical to Solidity)
- **Points system preserved**: 100/win, 10/dollar earned, 500 bonus for $1.00 game
- 2 tests passing (season lifecycle + point recording with assertions)

## Phase 6: Markets & Social

### prediction_market.move
- Ported `PredictionMarket.sol` (423 lines → ~380 lines Move)
- **Enum → u8 constants**: `MarketType` and `MarketStatus` enums become `const MARKET_WILL_WIN: u8 = 0`, etc.
- `MIN_BET = 100_000` octas (0.001 APT) vs `0.001 ether`
- Resource account holds all bet funds
- **Borrow conflict fix**: Move's linear type system prevents borrowing `state.bets` immutably and then mutably in the same scope. Fixed by using `*smart_table::borrow(...)` (copy) to read values, then borrowing mutably later. This is a pattern that comes up constantly — Solidity has no equivalent restriction.
- 2% platform fee on winning payouts
- 2 tests passing

### best_of_banker.move
- Ported `BestOfBanker.sol` (small, ~200 lines)
- **No modulo operator**: Move has no `%` — discovered at compile time. Solidity uses `uint256 % N` freely. Fixed by using a `SmartTable<VoteKey, bool>` with a struct key `VoteKey { quote_id: u64, voter: address }` instead of a composite integer key.
- Quotes stored in `vector<Quote>` (append-only, indexed by position)
- Upvote cost: $0.02 in APT via price feed conversion
- 1 test passing

### sponsor_vault.move
- Ported `SponsorVault.sol` (280 lines → ~250 lines Move)
- Resource account holds sponsor deposits and jackpot funds
- **50/50 jackpot split** preserved: half to player, half rolls over to next game
- Sponsor registration, top-up, game sponsoring all ported
- 1 test passing

## Phase 7: Cross-Chain (CCIP)

### ccip_gateway.move
- Ported `DealOrNotGateway.sol` as a **STUB**
- Collects entry fee and emits `CrossChainJoinSent` event
- **Real CCIP integration requires** the Chainlink CCIP Aptos package (deployed on mainnet/testnet)
- Production path: import `ccip::ccip_send()` from the starter kit pattern
- Documented the integration path in comments
- 1 test passing

### ccip_bridge.move
- Ported `DealOrNotBridge.sol` as a **STUB**
- Gateway registration (chain_selector → address) for authorized cross-chain sources
- `process_cross_chain_join` replaces Solidity's `_ccipReceive` callback
- **Real CCIP integration**: Deploy as resource account, register with CCIP router, implement `ccip_receive` callback
- 1 test passing

### Phase 5-7 Compilation Issues Summary

| Issue | Module | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------|------------|-----|
| No `%` operator | best_of_banker | Move has no modulo | Used struct key `VoteKey` in SmartTable |
| Shift requires `u8` | deal_or_not_agents | `bitmap >> i` needs `u8` shift amount | Cast loop counter to `u8`, cast back for comparisons |
| Missing `friend` | bank | `deal_or_not_agents` calls `settle()` | Added `friend deal_or_not::deal_or_not_agents` |
| Borrow conflict | prediction_market | Can't have `&` and `&mut` in same scope | Copy with `*borrow()`, then `borrow_mut()` later |
| Unused params | ccip_bridge, tests | Move warns on unused params | Prefix with `_` |

### Phase 5-7 Results

**Compilation**: 14 modules compile cleanly with `aptos move compile --dev`
**Tests**: 41/41 pass across all 14 modules

**Module count**: 14 Move modules porting 16 Solidity contracts (SharedPriceFeed merged into PriceFeedHelper)

## Final Summary

### What Was Ported

| # | Move Module | Solidity Source | Lines (Move) | Tests |
|---|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | game_math | GameMath.sol | ~80 | 6 |
| 2 | banker_algorithm | BankerAlgorithm.sol | ~250 | 14 |
| 3 | price_feed_helper | PriceFeedHelper.sol + SharedPriceFeed.sol | ~160 | 5 |
| 4 | bank | Bank.sol | ~230 | 2 |
| 5 | deal_or_not_quickplay | DealOrNotQuickPlay.sol + VRFManager.sol | ~500 | 0* |
| 6 | agent_registry | AgentRegistry.sol | ~290 | 3 |
| 7 | agent_staking | AgentStaking.sol | ~280 | 1 |
| 8 | deal_or_not_agents | DealOrNotAgents.sol | ~480 | 2 |
| 9 | seasonal_leaderboard | SeasonalLeaderboard.sol | ~310 | 2 |
| 10 | prediction_market | PredictionMarket.sol | ~380 | 2 |
| 11 | best_of_banker | BestOfBanker.sol | ~200 | 1 |
| 12 | sponsor_vault | SponsorVault.sol | ~250 | 1 |
| 13 | ccip_gateway | DealOrNotGateway.sol | ~120 | 1 |
| 14 | ccip_bridge | DealOrNotBridge.sol | ~130 | 1 |

*quickplay tests require randomness mocking which needs deeper test infrastructure

**Total**: 14 Move modules, ~3,660 lines of Move code, 41 passing tests

### Top Move-vs-Solidity Surprises

1. **No modulo operator** — `%` doesn't exist in Move. Use multiplication/division or restructure.
2. **Shift amounts must be `u8`** — `x >> y` requires `y: u8`, unlike Solidity where any uint works.
3. **No `int256`** — Every signed math operation needs a `(value, is_negative)` pattern.
4. **No enum** — Use `const X: u8 = 0` constants. More verbose but works.
5. **Borrow checker is real** — Can't hold `&` and `&mut` to the same resource simultaneously. Copy first, mutate later.
6. **No inheritance** — Abstract contracts become friend modules. Code duplication for shared helpers (bitmap functions duplicated in quickplay and agents).
7. **`doc comments + attributes` conflict** — `///` before `#[randomness]` causes warnings. Use `//` instead.
8. **Resource accounts are powerful** — `SignerCapability` lets modules act autonomously, cleaner than Solidity's `address(this).balance`.
9. **Move prevents reentrancy by design** — Linear type system makes Solidity-style reentrancy impossible. One less thing to worry about.
10. **APT 8 decimals vs ETH 18 decimals** — Off by 10^10 in every conversion formula. Must derive from first principles.

### What Would Change in Production

1. **Price Feed**: Replace mock `PriceFeedState` with Chainlink `data_feeds::router::get_benchmarks()` calls
2. **CCIP**: Import Chainlink CCIP Aptos package, implement real `ccip_send`/`ccip_receive` patterns
3. **Resolver Service**: Build off-chain service to submit `#[randomness]` TX2 transactions
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive game flow integration tests using `randomness::initialize_for_testing`
5. **Banker AI**: Integrate Gemini via off-chain service calling `set_banker_offer` as authorized signer

## Recommendations for Aptos Docs (for tippi's proposal)

### For AI/LLM Discoverability

1. **`<link rel="llms-txt" href="/llms.txt">`** in every page's `<head>` — LLM agents deep-link to topic pages and never see the nav/homepage. This meta tag would make llms.txt discoverable from ANY page.
2. **`/.well-known/llms.txt`** should redirect to `/llms.txt` (currently 404s). This is the standard location that many AI tools check first.
3. **Mention MCP server in llms.txt** — "For Claude Code users, install `@aptos-labs/aptos-mcp`". I only found the MCP server on my 3rd round of research.

### For Developer Experience

4. **Redirect old URLs** — `/build/smart-contracts/structs`, `/events`, `/unit-testing`, `/coins`, `/install-cli` all 404. Every dead link costs an LLM a round-trip. Humans get lost too.
5. **Solidity-to-Move migration guide** — A dedicated page mapping common patterns. Currently only CertiK's blog post fills this gap, and it may go stale. Key mappings needed:
   - `mapping` → `SmartTable` / `SimpleMap`
   - `int256` → `(u64, bool)` signed pattern
   - `approve/transferFrom` → capability refs (MintRef/BurnRef/TransferRef)
   - `address(this).balance` → resource account + SignerCapability
   - `abstract contract` → friend modules
   - `enum` → `const X: u8 = 0` pattern
   - `%` modulo → no equivalent, restructure algorithm
6. **Error code catalog** linked from error messages when `assert!` fails
7. **Move Book as primary entry point** — Individual topic pages under `/build/smart-contracts/` are hit-or-miss. The Move Book at `/build/smart-contracts/book` is comprehensive and stable. Recommend making it the primary navigation entry.

### For This Specific Project (Chainlink + Aptos)

8. **Chainlink Aptos packages documentation** — The actual on-chain Move source (`router.move`, `registry.move`) is the best reference, but it took `aptos move download` to get it. A "Chainlink on Aptos: Quick Reference" page with the key function signatures would save time.
9. **Randomness + privacy discussion** — The randomness page covers `#[randomness]` well but doesn't address the fact that Move resources are publicly readable via RPC. A note saying "randomness prevents validator manipulation but does NOT hide stored values" would prevent a common misconception.

## Phase 8: Frontend Integration

### NPM Packages Added
- `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` — Core Aptos SDK for view calls and transaction waiting
- `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` — React hooks for wallet connection (useWallet, connect, signAndSubmitTransaction)
- `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-core` — Peer dependency

### Architecture: ChainContext Pattern

The existing frontend uses wagmi + RainbowKit for EVM wallets. Aptos wallets are a completely different ecosystem. Rather than replacing the EVM wallet system, I created a `ChainContext` that sits above both:

```
ApolloProvider
  └─ Web3Provider (wagmi/RainbowKit)
    └─ AptosWalletProvider
      └─ ChainProvider ← detects which wallet is connected
        └─ App
```

`ChainContext` provides `activeChain: "evm" | "aptos" | "none"`, determined by:
1. If user explicitly prefers Aptos and Aptos wallet connected → aptos
2. If EVM connected and not preferring Aptos → evm
3. If only one wallet connected → that one
4. If neither → none

This lets every page check `isAptos` / `isEvm` to decide which hooks and UI to render.

### Key Frontend Learnings

**Aptos `account.address` is `AccountAddress`, not `string`**
Aptos SDK returns an `AccountAddress` object from `useWallet()`. Must call `.toString()` before slicing for display. Caught by TypeScript at build time.

**Dynamic imports required for wallet providers**
All wallet providers must be `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` because they access browser APIs (localStorage, window.ethereum, etc.) that don't exist during SSR.

**RainbowKit can't host Aptos wallets**
RainbowKit's `ConnectButton.Custom` only works with EVM wallets. There's no way to inject Aptos wallet options into the RainbowKit modal. This means the Aptos connect must be a separate UI element — currently a standalone "APT" button in the nav. A unified experience would require building a custom connect modal that wraps both RainbowKit and the Aptos wallet adapter.

**Aptos game phases map differently**
EVM has 9 phases (WaitingForVRF, Created, Round, WaitingForCRE, AwaitingOffer, BankerOffer, FinalRound, WaitingForFinalCRE, GameOver). Aptos has 7 (Created, Round, WaitingForReveal, AwaitingOffer, BankerOffer, FinalRound, GameOver). The game board page needs separate phase rendering for each chain.

**Entry fee requires on-chain view call**
EVM uses wagmi's `useReadContract` which auto-handles ABI decoding. Aptos uses `aptos.view()` which returns raw arrays that need manual parsing. Created a `useAptosEntryFee` hook that polls the price feed view function every 30 seconds.

### What's Not Wired Up Yet
- Game ID discovery (Aptos games don't auto-navigate to the new game)
- Aptos event log (EventLog component only reads EVM logs)
- APT balance display in play lobby
- Spectator/watch mode for Aptos games
- Agent, market, and best-of-banker pages for Aptos

### Playwright Testing
6 tests verify the Aptos UI elements render correctly:
- APT button visible in nav on all pages
- EVM connect button still works alongside APT
- Play page still shows EVM flow when no wallet connected
- Game ID input works for joining games

Tests are UI-level only (no wallet extension in Playwright browser). Real integration testing would require a mock Aptos wallet adapter or a custom test harness.

### The LLM Agent Browsing Pattern (Meta-Insight)

LLM agents don't browse docs like humans. The pattern is:
1. Search for specific topic (e.g., "Aptos randomness")
2. Land on deep page (e.g., `/build/smart-contracts/randomness`)
3. Read the page content
4. Never see sidebar navigation, homepage, or global links

This means **any discoverable resource that only lives in the nav/homepage is invisible to LLM agents**. The llms.txt link IS in the nav — but I went through 15+ page fetches before discovering it, because I never loaded the homepage.

The fix is redundancy: put discovery links in `<head>` meta tags, in page footers, and in `/.well-known/` — places that are visible regardless of how you arrive at the page.
